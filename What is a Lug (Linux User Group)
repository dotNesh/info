A Linux User Group, also known as LUG is a group of Linux users who come together to promote
the use of Linu OS, learn from others and provide support services to new users who may have
problems.

Generally for Non-Profit reasons, LUG members meet in person at an earlier location to discuss
new trends in the Free Software realms.

LUGs are open, non-politial, bipartisan and exixts primarily for support and learning new skills
in Linux Systems.

LUGs are also used to discuss matters like Technology, Science, Engineering and Innovation

Some LUGs are informal conferences or round table discussions; members simply sit around and chat 
about Linux-related topics. Some provide formal presentations.

LUGs near each other geographically sometimes get together to hold conferences and share knowledge 
among peers.

A few LUGs have developed projects of regional or even international stature. For example, 
the Uganda Linux User Group operates in 3 major cities and frequently coordinates national and 
international events that have featured guests as high-profile as Tim Berners-Lee.

GNU/Linux is a freely-distributable implementation of Unix for personal computers, servers, 
workstations, PDAs, and embedded systems. It was developed on the i386 and now supports a 
huge range of processors from tiny to colossal
